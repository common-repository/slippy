Take slipbox/zettelkasten style notes within WordPress.


== Description ==

Slippy allows you to take slipbox or zettelkasten style notes from within WordPress.

Notes are stored separately from your posts and pages, but otherwise use all of the features of WordPress. 

The best way to use Slippy is to add short, related notes as they come to you. Be sure to include any images or reference links that are relevant, and tag extensively.

After saving a note, or when editing existing notes, related notes will be displayed underneath, allowing you to discover previously unknown relationships between your thoughts. Notes can also be directly connected via the related notes feature.

Notes are able to be searched, or filtered by tag and category. The Full View shows all notes in full, allowing you to skim over recent or related notes to discover deeper connections.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= What are Zettelkasten / Slip Box Notes? =

Zettelkasten or Slip Box Notes are notes ordered by subject, with each note having it's own ID that can be used as a reference. Related notes follow on from the ID of the previous related note.

Slippy makes taking zettelkasten style notes easy by replacing the complex indexing system with the powerful tag system built into WordPress. 

You can read more about slip box notes [on our blog](https://www.lmnhq.com/blog/the-zettelkasten-method.html).


= Does Slippy adhere directly to the Zettelkasten System? =

Slippy makes use of the powerful tag system built into WordPress, so there's no complex indexing system as would be required by analog slip box notes.
